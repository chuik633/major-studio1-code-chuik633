# Concept and Sketches
The following are sketches exploring data visualizations of different data sets in the Smithsonian Open Access Collection.

![Hirshorn Art Timeline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4904e43a-ef36-428c-b706-18a54f093cb7)
TITLE: Timeline of Contemporary and Modern Art

DATASET: Hirshorn Museum of Contemporary and Modern Art

DATA INFO: 
Media
Artist
Date
Dimensions
Image Source
The dataset has around 11k data points

QUESTIONS
This explores the relationship between historical/social events and the art produced post WWII. It also looks into the influences and evolutions of modern art through highlighting similar media used, and allowing us to get a bigger picture of the art created through time.

VISUALIZATION METHODS
This uses a dot plot which allows us to each each individual data point. When zoomed in the dots become more representative of the actual art pieces kind of like glancing at the pieces in a museum.

![Women and Historical Text Frequencies](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39c61887-9e76-455b-a4a1-149bc4fcd050)
TITLE: Text Themes in Historical Depictions of Women

DATASET: Smithsonian Portrait gallery, NMNH advertisements

DATA INFO: 
This visualization works off of multiple datasets which include advertisements, posters, photography, portraits, letters, and writing. All of these have the following fields
media
date
description/text
location/context

QUESTIONS
This visualization explores the frequency of different words used in historical art, texts, and ads about women and uses a timeline to select the date to pull data from.

VISUALIZATION METHODS
This uses a bar plot that groups different word groups together that share common themes.

![Fish Length Plot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e720153c-0b93-414c-900b-f1c86a6c3e58)

TITLE: Fish lengths at different Depths

DATASET: NMNH Vertebrate Zoology -> Fish

DATA INFO: 
Taxonomy
length of the fish
depth range
geography
Very large (over 6 million specimines)

QUESTIONS
This explores the relationship between the length of fish and different depths.

VISUALIZATION METHODS
This uses a form of a box plot as well as a sideways line graph in order to give a big picture view for the trends in the min, max, and average lengths of fish at different depts. It also has options to filter based off of geographic location.
